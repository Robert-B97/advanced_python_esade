# Assignment advanced programming in python.

# How it will be graded?
The assignment will be a 10 % of the final grade.

# The evaluation criteria will be the following:
Rationale behind the design choices (30 %).
- Technical specifications.
- Architecture/execution model.
Clean code (40 %).
Documentation (20 %).
Extra features / optional code (10 %).

# Objectives:
The objective of this assignment is to familiarize the student with the concepts of advanced programming in python, including: classes, inheritance and program design in general.

# Exercice:
The exercise consists on the design and development of a program to manage a warehouse. Conceptual specifications:

The program must have the following fetures (constraints).
- Add stock.
- Remove stock.
- Get number of stock of a certain type.
- Three types of stock should be defined.

The program should provide at least one of the following functionality:
- Have two wearhouses were the stock can be shared between them.
- Provide a way of searching if stock is available.
- Create a report of all the stock available in the wearhouse.

# Parameters of the assignment:
These are the minimum code requirements to fullfil the assignment:
- Create 1 base class for generic stock.
- Use the generic class (inheritance) to define the different type of stock.
- Main wearhouse class should provide the functionality.
- All the code has to be documented appropriately.
Optional code features:
- Provide either a test file or use asserts to verify the program behaviour.
- Provide input parameters and its functionality.

# What needs to be in the report:
As this is a programming lecture, the report should contain both the rationale behind the design decisions, as well as the developed code (a couple of paragraphs on what the the tech spec, i.e. explain classes, functions etc., the execution model, i.e. theee graph with arrows showing how the execution flow). Moreover, a copy of the terminal execution should be provided as well.
The format of the report must be a signle pdf uploaded to the virtual campus.
The code can be uploaded to github as well, but in this case, a pdf is still needed with the rationale on the design choices, the ID of the commit that will be evaluated (to know when the development cycle ended), as well as a link to the repository.
